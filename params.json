{"name":"Prefab","tagline":"Pixel-Based Reverse Engineering of Graphical Interfaces","body":"### Welcome to Prefab.\r\nPrefab is a system for reverse engineering the structure of graphical interfaces from their pixels. In other words, Prefab looks at the pixels of an existing interface and returns a tree structure, like a web-page's document object model, that you can then use to modify the original interface in some way. Prefab works from example images of widgets; it decomposes those widgets into small parts, and exactly matches those parts in screenshots of an interface. Prefab does this many times per second to help you modify interfaces in real time. Imagine if you could modify any graphical interface? With Prefab, you can explore this question!\r\n\r\n###\r\nPrefab helps you implement your ideas in the _real world_. It provides tools for reverse engineering the appearance of widgets and interpreting the semantics about interfaces. Prefab is written in C# and runs on windows, but it can reverse engineer interfaces from any OS. Check out our [videos](# Videos) where Prefab interprets the pixels of a remote desktop application to reverse engineer Mac OS X interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe [demonstration videos](# Videos) provide numerous examples of the types of applications that can be built with the Prefab toolkit.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nPrefab's GitHub repositories are located at https://github.com/prefab. Start by checking out the [interpretation](https://github.com/prefab/interpretation). You can also checkout the demos repository and try running some of them to see how things work.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPrefab is a research project created in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](cs.washington.edu) at the [University of Washington](washington.edu) by [Morgan Dixon] (http://morgandixon.net) (@morgandixon) and [James Fogarty](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/) (@jayfo). Please see our [Prefab publications] (# Publications) for a complete list of research papers describing Prefab.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Prefab?
